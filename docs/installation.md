# Sticky Selectron Installation
## Recommendations
- Install this package first in a sandbox for testing.
- Install this package for all users. You'll display this component within a screen flow, which you control access to, so access for all users simplifies things. A Sticky Selectron permission set is created if you prefer to install it for Admin Only and assign access in your org's User settings.

## MetaDEPLOY Sticky Selectron Installation

On this page you'll see that you have the ability to install the Sticky Selectron LWC as well as an optional sample flow package.
