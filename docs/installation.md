# Installing Sticky Selectron
_Most of this documentation will happen once we have a package to do a run-through on it, and will be finished when the listing is live on the appexchange_

Best practices: We recommend installing this package first in a sandbox for testing.

Sticky Selectron is available on the Appexchange **here**.

Description of navigating the appexchange and what buttons to click 

Installation flow - see notes below


Notes to keep track of

- Screen shots
- Install for which users? Apex Class. (run a test to see if you select a profile if the apex class is assigned to the profile)
- Permission set assignment
- What it looks like from within a flow. - link to configuration page
- anything else?
