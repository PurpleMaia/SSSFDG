- Fast display of up to 2000 records
- Search in selectable records

This release does has the following field display known issues:
- Relationship fields display the ID of the related record. You can, however, display a formula field that references a related object.
- Checkboxes can be sorted but not filtered. Sorting will effectively show you records grouped by selected and unselected checkboxes.
