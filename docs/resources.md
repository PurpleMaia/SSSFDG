## Testing with Contact Test Data

We've create a set of test Contact data that you can load so that you can test Sticky Selectron in a Developer or or Sandbox.
This data includes custom fields which you can choose to create and load, or you can bypass.

![Data Loader field mapping SDL File](Assets/Resources Contact Map for DataLoader.sdl)

![Four test contact records](Assets/Resources MOCK_DATA Contact (4 samples).csv)

![Three thousand test contact records](Assets/Resources MOCK_DATA Contact v2.csv)

If you want to create custom fields for the test data - follow the ![attached pdf file to configure the custom fields](Assets/Resources Sticky Selectron Custom Contact Fields.pdf).
