## Testing with Contact Test Data

We've create a set of test Contact data that you can load so that you can test Sticky Selectron in a Developer or or Sandbox.
This data includes custom fields which you can choose to create and load, or you can bypass.

[Data Loader field mapping SDL File](Assets/Resources_Contact_Map_for_DataLoader.sdl)

[Four test contact records](Assets/Resources_MOCK_DATA_Contact_4_samples.csv)

[Three thousand test contact records](Assets/Resources_MOCK_DATA_Contact_v2.csv)

For the data upload using the data loader or data wizard - Update the formatting of the Birthdate field to a custom format of yyyy-mm-dd.

If you want to create custom fields for the test data - follow the [attached pdf file to configure the custom fields](Assets/Resources_Sticky_Selectron_Custom_Contact_Fields.pdf).
