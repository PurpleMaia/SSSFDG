# About

The Sticky Selectron Lightning Component allows for the selection of records to persist (or remain the same) while advancing through flow screens and then returning to the selection screen for any further modifications.

For example, if a housing complex offered afterschool programs like training, snacks, and one-on-one coaching where many of the same children participated in these activities, then our custom LWC would definitely streamline tracking attendance. It would make sure that if you selected 20 of 30 children for the first program, then that same set of children would be the default selection for the second program as the starting point where you could then revise the selection by adding and removing students instead of starting from zero. This is especially beneficial if you have a large number of contacts and participants that number in the hundreds which is the case for our client. We call this our “sticky” selection feature because the contact selection would persist while changing to other screens in the flow then returning to the contact selection screen for another round. That is why we gave the name “Sticky Selectron” to our LWC.

## Highlights

- Load several hundred records
- Sort and search records in datatable
- Allow selection of records to persist (or remain “sticky”) across flow screens
